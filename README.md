## Performance Testing

## Functional Requirements

- Features and Capabilities
- What function the system should perform
- Tangible and can be tested directly
- Examples: Login, Register, Search, etc.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Qualities beyond core functionality
- Describe how the system should perform
- Examples: Performance, Scalability, Security, Latency, etc.

## Types of Testing

1. Capacity Testing: how many users software handle before performance degrades
2. Load Testing: software can handle expected number of users without performance degrading
3. Stress Testing: simulating peak users, checking software's ability to handle peak load/traffic
4. Soak Testing: How well software performs under high activity level
5. Smoke Testing: Quick check to ensure core requirement works as expected.
6. Spike Testing: Testing software's ability to handle sudden spikes in traffic
7. Scalability Testing: Software's ability to scale up or down based on demand
8. Regression Testing: Testing software after changes to ensure no new bugs introduced
